Name: Colin Boccaccio

### Timeline

### Resources Used


### Running the Program

Main class: Ranks

Data files needed: Files data with formal yobYEAR.txt

Key/Mouse inputs: N/A

### Notes/Assumptions

-All files containing data have the format yobYEAR.txt (ex yob2001.txt)

-Data in folder FILE_PATH is continuous, meaning it contains data for
all years from FIRST_YEAR_IN_FOLDER to LAST_YEAR_IN_FOLDER

-All data files follow the format of "Name, Gender Initial, Number Occurrences" per line, and
lines appear in descending order according to occurrences for female then male names.

### Impressions

I initially made code that worked for the first submission, but needed to
completely rework the entire infrastructure of my code to work with the later
portions of the project, so for future projects I will try to look ahead so that
I can make my code with the future capabilities it will need to have in mind.
